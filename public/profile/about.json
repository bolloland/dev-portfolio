    "about": "I am a Fullstack Software Developer freshly out of Flatiron School Bootcamp, and looking for my ideal job that allows my perseverance and personality to shine. In the last year I have worked with Javascript(ES6), React, and Ruby on Rails. \n\n\n I started this new journey based on my love of puzzles, logic, problem solving and math. In my time at Flatiron I've worked with Redux, thunk, CSS, HTML, Github, Sinatra, SQLite, Netlify and VSC and am consistently seeking out new ways to solve issues on both the front and back ends. My 12 years as a teacher has allowed me to see problems through my students' eyes, and find multiple ways to explain concepts in a way that's specific to their needs. I find these same challenges arise when coding: `What is the best way to solve this specific problem?` n\n\n When I'm not coding or working as a math teacher, I'm spending time with my wife and two kids, updating my Letterbox watchlist, voraciously consuming music, joining puzzle hunts, beating escape rooms and playing guitar.",
